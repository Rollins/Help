	<b>Gross Rating Point (GRP)</b></p>
<blockquote style="border: currentColor">
	<p>
		A measurement of audience size (viewership or listenership) to quantify a medium&#39;s ability to reach a target audience. GRPs estimate the number of people a communication will reach, irrespective of audience duplication. GRPs are stated in terms of percentage: each GRP represents 1% of the people or households tuned to a TV program (as compared to the total number of TV sets in the market being studied). GRPs are calculated by multiplying the total <i>reach </i>of the media schedule by its <i>frequency</i>. Thus the product of reach and frequency expresses the gross duplicated percentage of audience that would be reached by the advertising vehicle. Comparisons of different media vehicles are done based on their respective cost per gross rating point.</p>
