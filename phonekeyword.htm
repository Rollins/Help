  <p>
    Reliable tracking that distinguishes between online and offline lead sources is important to marketing initatives. The call conversion tracking system enables Marketing to track almost every lead, sale and start for Orkin.</p>
  <p>Campaign codes are associated with a specific phone numer that identifies the source of the lead. A status is assigned to the lead, indicating whether the lead became a sale or start.</p>
  <p>The tracking, analysis, and optimization of leads is critical to Digital Marketing decisions. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;
<h4 id="intoidotcom2" style="margin-top:100px; border-top: thin solid #bcbeb0; width:50%"> Rollins Call Conversion Workflow</h4>
<p> Marketing Technology uses a conversion workflow to combine data from several sources. This workflow gathers records such as caller data,  click data, <a href="popcallconvert.html" target="popup" onclick="window.open('popcallconvert.html','popup','width=1400,height=900,scrollbars=no,resizable=no'); return false;"> </a>campaign code, and revenue data, then matches and combines this data for viewing in the Marin platform.</p>
<p>The Marketing team uses the Marin platform to analyze this data for lead optimization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h4 id="intoidotcom" style="margin-top:100px; border-top: thin solid #bcbeb0; width:50%">
  Call Conversion  Overview</h4>
<p>The following process describes the conversion of data. <a href="popcallconvert.html" target="popup" onclick="window.open('popcallconvert.html','popup','width=1100,height=350,scrollbars=no,resizable=no'); return false;"> Click here to see a diagram of this process. </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Import AvidTrack calls into RI-MDB</strong> - The daily process begins by importing calls into the <strong>Rollins Integration Marketing Database</strong> (<strong>RI-MDB</strong>). To determine which calls are associated with AvidTrak, each number in the AvidTrak replacement bank is associated to a unique Marketing Campaign and VDN. Each Marketing Campaign is associated with a Marketing Program. Marketing Programs have a field indicating its inclusion in AvidTrak. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Export calls to AvidTrak</strong> - After calls are imported into the Rollins Integration MDB, they are then exported to AvidTrak and marked as exported.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Match exported calls in AT session</strong> - AvidTrak matches the start and end times of the recorded sessions to the call connect and terminate times of the exported&nbsp;calls. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Match click data in RI-MDB</strong> - Click data is downloaded from AvidTrak paid client APIs and matched to calls stored in the <strong>Rollins Integration MDB</strong>. It is important to match only paid clicks, because only these clicks need to be exported to Marin. These calls  now have their associated click data stored in the <strong>RI-MDB</strong>.</p>
<p>
	<strong>ODS generate conversion file</strong> - Using the VDNs associated with leads, ODS matches lead/sold/start data to call VDNs in the <strong>Rollins Integration MDB</strong> and generates a conversion file with revenue data. Matching is done on calls for 10 days previous to ensure enough time is given to close the lead/sold/start sales loop.</p>

<p id="limprocess"><strong>System Processes</strong></p>
<p>
	These processes are executed daily by ODS and Marketing Technology. They generate and use the artifacts to implement the call matching process.</p>
<h5 style="font-weight: bolder">
	ODS: Generate Calls File Export</h5>
<p>
	This process generates the&nbsp;CallsImport file described above.</p>
<h5 style="font-weight: bolder">
	CallsImport</h5>
<p>
	After the CallsImport file is generated, the CallsImport process retrieves it from the network share and imports the calls in the Rollins Integration MDS <em>Calls </em>and <em>CallCases</em>&nbsp;tables. The CallCases table is a master detail table for calls associated with multiple  cases. During the import process, the call is matched to a marketing campaign by the VDN associated with the dialed phone number. CallsImport also processes any available Calls File Export since the last successful import.</p>
<h5 style="font-weight: bolder">
	CallsCdrExport</h5>
<p>
	After the calls are available in the <em>Calls</em> and&nbsp;<em>CallCases</em> tables, the&nbsp;CallsCdrExport process generates the&nbsp;Call Detail Record Export. This file is uploaded to the AvidTrak FTP directory for import into the AvidTrak portal.</p>
<h5 style="font-weight: bolder">
	CallsAppend</h5>
<p>
	After AvidTrak completes the import of the call details, the CallsAppend process uses the AvidTrak API to download all  calls matched to an AvidTrak call. The CallBidKeywordText, KeywordId, CreativeId, MatchType values, if available, are appended to the existing call data in the&nbsp;<em>Calls</em> table. The CallClickDataAppended field is also set, indicating the call has been appended and additional processing will not append data to the call.</p>
<h5 style="font-weight: bolder">
	ODS: Generate Conversion Files</h5>
<p>
	This process retrieves conversion data for both web and phone leads, matches it to keyword data stored in the Rollins Integration MDB <em>Calls </em>table, and exports the Marin Conversion Files.</p>
<h5 style="font-weight: bolder">
	OdsLeadDataFtpUploadToMarin</h5>
<p>
	After the combined web and phone conversion file is generated, the OdsLeadDataFtpUploadToMarin process transfers the file to the Marin FTP <span style="font-family:'Courier New'; "> /km271vm0l0/combined-conv-phone</span>&nbsp;directory. Marin then uploads the data and bid optimizations can begin.</p>

<h5 style="font-weight: bolder">
	Linking a Call to a Case ID</h5>
<p>
	Linking a Call to a Case ID represents the key challenge in generating the ODS Calls File Export. Though Edge records the originating number of an in-bound call on the case it creates, it does not distinguish the specific call that generated the case from other calls from the same originating number. Therefore, to tie an Edge case to a a call in CMS the timestamp of the call and the timestamp of the Edge case must be &quot;ligned up&quot; to correlate the two.</p>
<h2>
	Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>
	When a call comes in to the RCSC, an Edge case is automatically initiated but <em>not</em> created until the agent explicitly saves the record. Therefore the Edge case may be created any time during or after the call, preempting a simple correlation. Agent&#39;s spend on average two minutes on &quot;after call work&quot; and may not save the case until the after call work is completed.</p>
<p>
	Finally, Edge and CMS are on the same Time Zone but should not be assumed to be synchronized with one another, or even to have a consistent difference (a reboot may cause one system to become more or less synchronized with the other).</p>
<h2>
	Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		The clocks between Edge and CMS are accurate within plus-or-minus two minutes of each other.</li>
	<li>
		An agent will spend no more than 5 minutes on after call work.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
	Matching Cases to Calls</h2>
<p>
	A call can be linked to a case if:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The Edge case&#39;s originating number matches the call record&#39;s originating number.</li>
	<li>
		AND the Edge case creation timestamp is greater than or equal to two minutes <em>prior</em> to the call connection time.</li>
	<li>
		AND the Edge case creation timestamp is less than or equal to seven minutes <em>after</em> the call termination time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
	Which Calls to Consider</h2>
<p>
	Only calls to <em>active</em> phone numbers or VDNs in the Digital Acquisition marketing program should be considered for tying call records to Edge cases, all other data can be discarded for the purposes of Liminal. It may later be necessary to include all active phone numbers and VDNs, should the reporting structure ever be split out. A phone number or VDN is considered &quot;active&quot; in the RollinsIntegration.MarketingCampaigns table if the MarketingCampaignStartDateTime value is less than or equal to the current time AND the MarketingCampaignEndDateTime is greater than the current time OR null.</p>
<h2>
	Special and Unusual Cases</h2>
<h3>
	Same Phone Number</h3>
<p>
	This scenario occurs when a multiple calls from <em>different</em> customers are generated by the <em>same</em> originating number.</p>

<p>
	The originating number is from a call tracking platform, Telmetrics in this case, and the actual originating number was unobtainable. Originating numbers may be unobtainable if the calling party is dialing from a private or unlisted phone number.

</table>
<p>
	Note that the same call generated both cases.</p>
<h4>
	How to Handle</h4>
<p>
	The ODS Calls File Export must list both cases; in other words, it should list the same call twice. The Marin Conversion File Export must count both cases appropriatly in the sold, start, and revenue numbers. For example, if both cases become sales but only one becomes a start then the &quot;phonesold Conv&quot; and &quot;phonestart Conv&quot; values would be incremented by 2 and 1, respectively.</p>
<h3>
	Multiple Calls for a Single Case</h3>
<p>
	This can occur when a customer calls back and references a service/lead created earlier.</p>
<h4>
	How to Handle</h4>
<p>
	The ODS calls file export will list the same call twice, however each will have its own case ID. When the Marin conversion file is created, however, the call will only be listed once, with the&nbsp;<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); line-height: 18px">phonelead Conv column incremented for each call.</span></p>
<h1>
	Linking Clicks to Calls</h1>
<p>
	The ODS Calls File Export will link calls to Edge cases. This data is imported into RollinsIntegration then exported to AvidTrak via the <strong>Call Detail Record (CDR) Export</strong>. AvidTrak processes the CRD file by matching the records in the file against its phone line pool allocation history. For this project, it is not important <em>how</em> AvidTrak works, only <em>that</em> it works. Once AvidTrak has performed the matching, the appended data is loaded back into RollinsIntegration.</p>
<p>
	AvidTrak requires roughly 30 minutes to match call data to click data and incorporate the details into reports. To be safe, click data should not be loaded until <em>at least 60 minutes</em> after it has been loaded into AvidTrak.</p>
<h1>
	Linking Click-and-Call Data to Sales, Starts, and Revenue</h1>
<p>
	Once click data has been downloaded from AvidTrak and appended to the call data that was imported from ODS, thus forming combined records of click and call data, which will include the Edge case ID. ODS then loads the appended data, using the Edge case ID to determine the sale and start count, as well as contract value (revenue amount).</p>
<h1>
	Risks</h1>
<p>
	<strong>Network Connectivity</strong> - if for some reason the network isn&#39;t available at any point during the process, the whole process will fail and no data can be uploaded to Marin. This occurred under the following situations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		When we switched office buildings in November 2013.</li>
	<li>
		In December 2013, IT revoked access to port 1433 in the firewall, blocking us from accessing the necessary Azure SQL Server database.</li>
	<li>
		During routine security updates to Daniel&#39;s computer, currently hosting the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>ODS Call File Export file not generated</strong> - Occasionally the daily AvidTrak file isn&#39;t generated properly. In this situation the process will fail and no data will be uploaded to Marin. This occurred in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		12/20/2013 - when IT upgraded the FTP service. In the future this should be coordinated with IT.</li>
	<li>
		12/4/2013 -&nbsp;Per Michele:&nbsp;&quot;Focus is working on data updates that will run thru the night tonight, so we cannot run ODS. You&rsquo;ll be able to run reports tomorrow, but they will not have today&rsquo;s data. We should be able to catch-up tomorrow night for reporting on Friday.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Password Change</strong> - Domain requirements specify regular password resets. If the scheduled tasks are not updated with the new password the process will fail and no data will be uploaded to Marin.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Host system shut-down</strong> -&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		manual shut down</li>
	<li>
		remote shut down from IT</li>
	<li>
		system crash</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>AvidTrak API returns improperly formatted XML</strong> - This has occurred twice:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		first during the initial testing phase, and second in production on 1/3/2014.</li>
	<li>
		Both times were quickly resolved by Amin and his team at AvidTrak and successive API calls were successful.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Liminal Process Import Exception and Trouble shooting and fixing the import Issue -&nbsp;</strong>the process fails to update the last successful run date that occurs due to some exception occurs at the run time.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Request Timeout -&nbsp;</strong>this exception occurs due to the AvidTrak Web Service fail to response in timely manner. it may happen due to the AvidTrak Server was not responding to the calls made by the web services. this error occurred on 12/31/2014</p>

<p><strong>Linking Calls to Case IDs</strong></p>
<p>
  The <a href="http://avidtrak.com/Call_Tracking_API.php" target="new">AvidTrack API</a> provides:<a border="0" class="fb_attachment" href="default.asp?pg=pgDownload&amp;pgType=pgWikiAttachment&amp;ixAttachment=12316&amp;sFileName=Avidtrak%20Webservice%20API.docx" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title=""></a></p>
<ol>
	<li>
	  The caller&#39;s phone number (via Caller ID:&nbsp;<strong>caller</strong>).</li>
	<li>
		The number called (the solution&#39;s provided number:&nbsp;<strong>tracking_number</strong>).</li>
	<li>
		Timestamps for when the call was dialed (<strong>call_datetime</strong>) and ended (<strong>duration</strong>).</li>
	<li>
		Markeiting Campaign ID</li>
	<li>
		Mkwid</li>
	<li>
		Creative ID (<strong>adid</strong>).</li>
	<li>
		Bid Keyword Text (<strong>search_keyword</strong>).</li>
	<li>
		Match Type (<strong>match_type</strong>).</li>
</ol>
<p>
	A Call Detail Record (CDR) feed from RCSC must contain the following information:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		The caller&#39;s phone number (via Caller ID).</li>
	<li>
		The number of the line dialed.</li>
	<li>
		Time-stamps for when the call was received and answered. Preferably in UTC.</li>
	<li>
		The Case ID associated with the call.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	The CDR feed is loaded to AvidTrak, matching each call to keyword, creative, and other tracked fields. This data is loaded from AvidTrak to RollinsIntegration, and ultimately back into ODS where it can be linked to case status (lead, sold, start) and the&nbsp;<strong>revenue file</strong>&nbsp;can contain phone data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anomalous Scenarios</p>
<p><strong>Linking Clicks to Calls</strong></p>
<p>The ODS Calls File Export links calls to Contact360 cases. This data is imported into RollinsIntegration then exported to AvidTrak via the <strong>Call Detail Record (CDR) Export</strong>. AvidTrak processes the CDR file by matching the records in the file against its phone line pool allocation history. After AvidTrak has performed the matching, the appended data is loaded back into RollinsIntegration.</p>
<p> IMPORTANT:AvidTrak requires roughly 30 minutes to match call data to click data and incorporate the details into reports. To be safe, click data should not be loaded until <em>at least 60 minutes</em> after it has been loaded into AvidTrak.</p>
